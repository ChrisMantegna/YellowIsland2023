The goal of the writing prompts is to spur a daily practice of reflecting on your experience, engaging with your observations, and planning your larger project. Each day you should spend ~30 minutes responding to the given prompts, reflecting on something else that has engaged your interest, etc. There is no prescribed way to do this, you can answer the same prompt multiple times, it can be drawings or mind maps - the only requirement is that you do your reflection in your journal, not via computer. 

1. When you think of community, what comes to mind? Does that same thought or image translate to communities of intertidal species? Subtidal? Terrestrial?
2. Thinking of the barriers youâ€™ve faced in environmental science, what have they revealed about you to you? 
3. Thinking of your first trip to Yellow, what sights, smells, sounds felt familiar? Feels alien? What did that invoke for you?
4. Summer in the PNW is a beautiful spectacle, what does Summer look like in the place you call home? How is it similar? Different?
5. The regulated access to Yellow gives us space to learn and enjoy without the fear of negative interaction, but it can also feel isolating. How do you feel balancing these things? Does this binary framing feel fair or appropriate to you?
